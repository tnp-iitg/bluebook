1. ### Assessment Round Questions

> 2 DSA questions, 1 was a 2D DP problem, another one a modification of the merge sort algorithm. 10 Deep Learning Theory Questions, the theory questions were quite simple if you have completed the Coursera DL Specialization.

Round 1: No intro was asked, dived straight into some Machine learning basics. I had an ML Publication, so I was asked about the models used in that paper, why I used them, and then asked about the working of some of the models mentioned. There were two classes of methods used in my publication, bagging and boosting, and they asked me about their differences. Then asked me some theory about decision trees and what metrics are used to evaluate, such as impurity and entropy. I said I knew the terms and working but not the math. Then coding started; first, they did some simple implementation of Heap in Python from scratch. They asked me to explain my process. Make sure you don't just type and say nothing; explain why you are typing whatever you are typing. The next question was a simple infix to postfix code, and they asked me to implement a stack and solve it through that. After this, they asked some more ML theory, such as tell me the difference between an infinite neural network and an infinite decision tree. They then said to wait for feedback. Round 2: This time, a proper intro was asked. This round contained 0 ML stuff; it was a pure DSA round. First, I was asked a DP + strings question. I couldn't solve it and told the interviewer honestly; he said ok, let's move on. Then, the question was on edit distance, and I solved it and explained my thought process. For both questions, time and space complexity was asked. When it came to my turn to ask questions, I asked the interviewer to explain the solution of the first question. They then said to wait for feedback. Round 3: The most brutal one, both DSA + ML Coding involved. First, the interviewer gave me an ML case study. They then asked me to describe the complete end-to-end process of implementing a system to detect Twitter trolls for their clients. I explained the data points one can capture and different aspects of the accounts we can observe to classify if anyone is a bot. Asked one basic DSA, solved that without an issue. Then, the interviewer asked a string-matching question, and I solved it with a sub-optimal solution; the interviewer kept asking what sort of data structure could be used here for optimal. I said I didn't know, and he told me Trie would be used. Then we moved on. The interviewer asked me to implement ML models from scratch, to pretend as if I was writing code for the Scikit Learn library, such as proper variable names, OOPs concepts, object definitions, and all that. The interviewer said my ML was good, but I needed some DSA practice. They also mentioned that before answering, I should take some time to think. He noted that sometimes, I answered too fast and missed specific cases. Before leaving, he asked a probability question, it was a question requiring the use of Bayes Theorem. Round 4: HR Best round I had, and in my opinion, public speaking skills will help infinitely in this round. I had not prepared any HR questions. But if you can articulate your ideas well, it works out alright. Anytime I spoke, HR used to write something down. First, I was asked to give an extensive intro about my journey in college. Then, I was asked about the differing aspects of myself as viewed by my parents, brother, or friends. I explained the three differing viewpoints with concrete examples. The interviewer liked the answer, as I had included personal anecdotes. Then, I was given some situations about what steps I would take in a brainstorming meeting I had organised to ensure a good flow of information. I took the last interviewer's advice and thought hard about this. Answered in a structured manner, and the interviewer was happy with the answer. She pointed out some more considerations I might have to take in, such as language barriers. The next question was to describe a situation where I helped someone by going out of my way. I told some junior's story and how I helped in academics. After that, she asked me three pieces of advice I

Be as thorough with DSA as possible. You should also be fully revised with ML and DL theory both.
