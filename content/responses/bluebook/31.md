6. ### Interview Experience (share the questions asked in the interview/expectation of the panel)

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

During the panel interview, they were more interested in your personality rather than just your knowledge. In the first interview, only one person was present, who turned out to be highly experienced in the mechanical field, with over 13 years of interview experience. He started by introducing himself and then asked about you. During the interview, he brought in another person online who was a psychologist. They both reviewed your CV and asked questions about your internships, focusing on topics like pumps, mechanical maintenance types, compressors, heat exchangers, and how centrifugal pumps work. They delved into different terminologies related to pumps, discussed why mechanical seals are important, and common pump failures like cavitation and how to prevent it. They also asked about the difference between pumps and compressors, NPSH (Net Positive Suction Head) available and required, and then shifted to discussing conduction, convection, and radiation, including how radiation occurs. Moving on to my project section on the CV, they inquired about tolerance and clearance fit. Towards the end, they presented a situational question: "As a new manager, what would you do if your workers were not completing their work on time knowing you're new to the role?". I wasn't sure if I'd get selected. We all had to go through another round of interviews. I entered a room and met with the HR person, who was really friendly. He spoke to me in Hindi, asking about my family background and my interest in the oil sector, almost like a casual chat between friends rather than a formal interview. He asked me if I had any questions to ask. I asked about how Reliance manages its various sectors and their connections, and he happily explained for about five minutes. He seemed to be very happy with my question. He emphasized the importance of personality over prior knowledge and talked about trustworthiness. He was really approachable throughout. At the end, he asked if I had any more questions. I replied, 'Let me join first, then we will surely have a nice conversation.' We shook hands, and that was the end of the interview.

Go through your CV first. Learn basic theory of mechanical subjects. You do not need to go for depth. Just simple learn that is convection, Laws of thermodynamics, what is clearance fit, what is cavitation (for example), learn basics.
