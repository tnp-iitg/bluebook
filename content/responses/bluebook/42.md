> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

In the first round, interviewer gave me a coding question which had multiple parts in it. First it was required to import json data from a dataset, which had 4-5 fields. We needed to store the data in such a way so that the retrieval of data in a certain way become easier. We also needed to perform certain operations on the data before retrieving it. Basically map was required in this question. He wanted me to use Oops concept to solve this problem like making different classes and functions. Also first he wanted me to solve this question using Javascript but I did it in cpp. I was not able to solve the question properly but he was convinced that I know all the oops and maps concept. After that he asked me basic networks and os questions. This round lasted for almost an hour. Second round was HR round with all the basic hr questions and discussion on my internship and projects. It lasted around 45 mins.
