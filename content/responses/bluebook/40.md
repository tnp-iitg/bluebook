> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

Since i was from EP, they did not ask specific Mechanical questions. For me most questions were stuff from JEE physics. Things like why does a non-point contact of cycle tyre cause it to stop. Also stuff about corriolis force etc. If youre from mechanical core, your interview questions WILL be different

> First round is taken by an employee who grills on bookish knowledge. Second is taken by their first employee who asks both technical and HR sorta questions, but he will grill you on your resume. Third round is taken by CEO/CTO who asks JEE mains level maths questions. Third round is pretty chill but he may reject you there as well so DONT give that round casually.
