1. ### Assessment Round Questions

---

2. ### Level of Difficulty of the Assessment Round (1-5)

> 4

---

3. ### Tips/Sources for the Assessment Round preparation

> Be ready to answer whatever is added in your CV, they will go deep when asking questions, don't restrict yourself from learning ML(if your profile is ML) or any profile for that matter. They asked tough questions on my experience part as well, I had founded a small venture of my own, they went very deep(unit economics of the product). So, please be sure of what you put in the CV. I had an FRM, that helped me a lot too. So they asked a lot about Risk management. Basically, anything and everything in your CV should be in the tip of your tongue. Certifications like FRM is a major plus.
